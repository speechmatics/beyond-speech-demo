Oh my God, Bernie. What happened? Well,

2
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.180
let's just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.470
fridge, make trips.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.220
[Applause]

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.540
[Laughter]

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.890
You're sure you're okay? Yeah, it's just a precaution. If there was a problem,

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.410
I'd be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now.

8
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.830
Sorry, Mr. Burdett. No, don't worry about it. I

9
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.760
brought the date here. Guys, come on in.

10
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.610
What's all this? Well, tonight is the

11
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.820
anniversary of our date, and I wanted to celebrate it

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.750
by writing a song for you.

13
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.750
Sheldon, get over here. She might be

14
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.140
contagious. You think I'm having a rough

15
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.250
[Laughter]

16
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.250
[Applause]

17
00:00:47.140 --> 00:01:01.360
enough day?

18
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.810
[Laughter]

19
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.090

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.410

[Music]

24
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.300
If I didn't have you, life would be

25
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.970
blue. I'd be Doctor Who without the

26
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.620
Tardis. Is it me or do you not look so good?

27
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.760
[Laughter]

28
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.160
A candle without a wick. A Watson without a crick. I'd be

29
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.490
of my outfits. Without a dicky. I'd be cheese

30
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.560
without the Mac. Jobs without the

31
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.890
Wozniak. I'd be solving exponential equations that use

32
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.260
bases not found on your calculator, making much harder to crack.

33
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.650
Abby and Adam without a bomb, a dot without the com.

34
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.010
And I probably still live with my mom,

35
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.880
and he probably still live with his mom.

36
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.970
Ever since I met you. You turned my world around. You

37
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.420
supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You're like

38
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.820
[Music]

39
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.360
uranium and I'm uranium.

40
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.880
Almost inseparable

41
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.240
isotopes.

42
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
[Music]

43
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.010
[Music]

44
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.600
I couldn't have imagined how

45
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.960
good my life would get from the

46
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.770
[Music]

47
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.840
moment that I met you,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
[Music]

49
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.110
Bernadette. If I

50
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.890
[Music]

51
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.340
didn't have you. Here

52
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.730
I'd be string theory without any string. I'd be

53
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.780
[Music]

54
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.380
[Music]

55
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.910
binary code without a, a cathode ray. Without an electron gun, I'd be

56
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.300
Firefly, Buffy, and Avengers. Without Joss Whedon, I'd speak a

57
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.870
lot more Klingon. Colockum bomb.

58
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.010
And he'd definitely still live with his mom.

59
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.190
Ever since I met you, you turned my world around.

60
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.520
You're my best friend and my lover. We're,

61
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.860
[Music]

62
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.370
like, changing electric and magnetic

63
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.060
fields. You can't have

64
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940
[Music]

65
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.050
without the other.

66
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.670
[Music]

67
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.470
I couldn't have imagined how good

68
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.350
my life would get from the

69
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.350
moment that I met you,

70
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.790
[Music]

71
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.830
Bernadette. Oh,

72
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.990
[Music]

73
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.120
we couldn't have a night.

74
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.870
[Music]

75
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.380
How good our lives would get.

76
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.290
[Music]

77
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.040
From the moment that we met.

78
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:21.410
Further down.

79
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.980
[Music]

80
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.620
[Applause]

81
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.710
[Applause]

82
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.710
That was amazing. Look. I'm shaking.

83
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.240
She's sick. I knew it by.

84
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200
[Laughter]
