00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.280
legs. And he walks out.

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.240

11
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.390
And sometimes more. It's more. It's weird running, being naked. I don't no

12
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.810
one who's more intrusive is Alausa. And what we got

13
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.140

[Laughter]

16
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.870

17
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
[Laughter]

18
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.270

It goes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Out of cup to. And he sugars, it went

21
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.710
13. That's not a cup of

22
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.190
tea anymore. It's a pudding. That's

23
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.340
an angel to of a teabag and

24
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.820
13 sugars. I know make sticking it in three quarters of

25
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.150

26
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200

Terry's come round. And it's bittersweet for him. Is it?

34
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:42.670
What are you going to do? This job. I want it done before your foot comes off. Right.

35
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.750
[Laughter]

36
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.630
[Laughter]

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.060
You know how to kick out the fridge? Right foot. Right. Let's get back. Onside kick.

[Laughter]

42
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.210
[Applause]

43
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.830
I thought you looked at me funny. Sorry, I

44
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.870
so I said that like it was your name.

45
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.510
[Laughter]

46
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.950

Oh, God. Hello, Forefingers. How's it going?

56
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.860

[Laughter]

59
00:02:48.280 --> 00:03:00.700

60
00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.600
[Applause]

61
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.880
